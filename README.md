# Bullseye!

"Bullseye!" is a new algorithm for computing the Gaussian Variational Approximation of a target distribution. Its strong point lies in the fact that it can easily be parallelized and distributed.

## C++ version

The current repository contains an implementation of the bullseye method in C++. It does not represent in itself the outcome of a project, but is a first attempt in the discovery phase of the algorithm and the different possible implementations.
To see a finalized version, refer to the repository [bullseye](https://github.com/Whenti/bullseye/).

This version has dependencies, and uses boost v1.68 and Eigen v3.3.5.

The project was developed under Visual Studio, so the project file was included.
